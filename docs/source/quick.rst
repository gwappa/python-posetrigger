Launching Pose-Trigger
-----------------------

1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the following command on Terminal:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        $ pose-trigger

.. note::
    When being run without a parameter, Pose-Trigger will use the device at ``/dev/video0`` by default. In case you want to use e.g. ``/dev/video1``, specify the device as the parameter, i.e. run ``pose-trigger /dev/video1``.

Organization of the main window
--------------------------------

    Overview of the main window

The Pose-Trigger main window can be divided into three groups:

* The **Capture** buttons (yellow) are for starting/stopping acquisition.
* The **Preview** panel (green) provides an on-line preview of the acquired video frames. If estimation of body-part positions is activated (refer to :ref:`DeepLabCut evaluation<pose-evaluation>`), estimated positions will be shown as colored circles, too.
* In the **Settings** panel (blue), you can configure how acquisition is performed (refer to the :ref:`Panel-by-panel guide<panels>`).

Capturing videos
-----------------

.. _capture-modes:

Capture modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two modes of running for Pose-Trigger:

* **FOCUS mode**: capturing video frames without storing them
* **ACQUIRE mode**: captures video frames *and* stores acquired data

You can start/stop either of the capturing modes by clicking on the button at the bottom of the main window.

.. caution::
    **Pose-Trigger does !not! stream data into storage during acquisition!** During acquisition, it keeps all the data in-memory. The data will be written out to a file only *after* acquisition. The duration of acquisition will be thus limited to the order of 1â€“2 minutes.

.. note::
    Currently, the following parameters are "hard-coded" and used as default:

    - Image format: 640x480 pixels, 16-bit grayscale
    - Timing generation: a busy-wait algorithm
    - Storage format: the NumPy zip-file format (.npz)

Format of the saved files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data are saved in the NumPy zip-file format (i.e. ".npz" file). Each file includes the following entries:

.. table:: Entries in saved files

    ================== =============  ========================================================================================
    Name               Always there?  Description
    ================== =============  ========================================================================================
    ``frames``         Yes            the 3-D frame data, (frame-index, height, width)
    ``timestamps``     Yes            1-D array containing unix timestamps in seconds
    ``metadata``       Yes            a JSON-serialized text object containing information on acquisition configuration
    ``estimation``     No (Optional)  when a DeepLabCut project is selected; 3-D array with the (frame-index, parameter) shape
    ``trigger_status`` No (Optional)  when pose-evaluation is enabled; 1-D boolean array of evaluation results
    ================== =============  ========================================================================================

.. admonition:: TODO

    add some examples for metadata (and probably for other entries, too)
