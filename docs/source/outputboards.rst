.. caution::
   ``arduino-fasteventtrigger``, in reality, will **only make use of the serial-to-USB conversion tip on the UNO (i.e. ATmega16U2)**.
   This means:

   - Make sure that your UNO clone has the ATmega16U2 as its converter chip.
   - Other USB-based boards that uses the ATmega16U2 chip *may* work (not recommended nor supported).
