== Introduction

=== What can Pose-Trigger do?

Pose-Trigger is designed to work on a linux computer equipped with a high-speed video camera.
The current version of the software features:

. Acquisition of *high-speed videos* (up to 100-200 fps without on-line pose estimation).
.. On-line exposure/gain adjustment.
.. Adjustment of acquisition intervals.
. *On-line estimation of body-part positions* using http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut[DeepLabCut].
.. On-line evaluation of *arbitrary posture conditions* based on the estimated body-part positions.
.. *Fast output-trigger generation* (<1 ms) using the https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3843623[FastEventServer] program.
. *Brightness/contrast adjustment* for on-line display.
. *Storage of frames* into the NumPy-style zip archive.

== Installation

=== Minimum installation requirements

At the very basics (i.e. acquisition), you need the followings:

. *A linux computer* (tested on https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.5/[Ubuntu 18.04 LTS])
. An installation of **Python, version >=3.4**. We recommend installing the following libraries using e.g. https://www.anaconda.com/[Anaconda]:
.. NumPy
.. Matplotlib
.. python-opencv
.. PyQt (required for pyqtgraph)
.. http://pyqtgraph.org/[pyqtgraph] (through `pip`, instead of through `conda`)
. a 16-bit monochrome video camera from https://www.theimagingsource.com/[ImagingSource]. Other Video4Linux2-compliant cameras should also work with a few adjustments in the code, but will require some efforts.

=== Installation requirements: on-line position estimation

In addition, the on-line position-estimation feature requires the followings in your environment:

. An installation of http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut[*DeepLabCut*] (any versions after 1.11 should work).
. For a faster working of DeepLabCut, *NVIDIA graphics board with a large amount of RAM* would be needed. For example, running DeepLabCut on ResNet-50 requires ~10.6 GB of RAM, so we use https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/geforce/graphics-cards/rtx-2080-ti/[GeForce RTX 2080 Ti] that has 11 GB on-board RAM.

=== Installation requirements: fast-trigger generation

Finally, the fast-trigger feature requires the followings:

. The https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3843623[*FastEventServer*] *server program*. If you use a 64-bit linux computer (it is most likely these days), you can use the `FastEventServer_linux_64bit` pre-built program bundled with the repository, and do not have to build it yourself.
. An https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3[*Arduino UNO*] or its clone, flashed using the https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3515998[arduino-fasteventtrigger] program.

[IMPORTANT]
=========
*IMPORTANT NOTE*: `arduino-fasteventtrigger`, in reality, will *only make use of the serial-to-USB conversion tip on the UNO (i.e. https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega16U2[ATmega16U2])*. This means:

- Make sure that your UNO clone has the ATmega16U2 as its converter chip.
- Other USB-based boards that uses the ATmega16U2 chip _may_ work (not recommended nor supported).

=== Install procedures

Install all the python packages in your DeepLabCut environment, in case it applies.

. If you need DeepLabCut, install it first.
. Install the libraries specified in "minimum requirements".
. Install `timedcapture`: this is the library for video acquisition. Follow the installation procedure in the repository.
. Install the `pose-trigger` module:
.. Clone this repository.
.. Open this repository in `Terminal`.
.. Run `pip install .` on `Terminal`.
. You can install `FastEventServer` and connect Arduino at any moment during the procedure (please refer to Appendix).

[TIP]
Upon the public release of Pose-Trigger in the future, both `timedcapture` and `pose-trigger` packages will be made available in PyPI. One will be able to install these packages through `pip`.

== Quick guide

=== Launching Pose-Trigger

. Open `Terminal`.
. Run `pose-trigger` on `Terminal`.

[TIP]
When being run without a parameter, Pose-Trigger will use the device on `/dev/video0` by default. In case you want to use e.g. `/dev/video1`, specify the device as the parameter, i.e. run `pose-trigger /dev/video1`.

=== Organization of the main window

.Overview of the main window
image::resources/Layout_Overview.png[Overview of the main window]

The Pose-Trigger main window can be divided into three groups:

. The *Capture* buttons (yellow) is for starting/stopping acquisition.
. The *Preview* panel (green) is an on-line preview of the acquired video frames. If body position-estimation is activated, estimated positions will be shown as colored circles, too.
. In the *Settings* panel (blue), you can configure how acquisition is performed.

=== Capturing videos

==== Capture modes

There are two modes of running for Pose-Trigger:

. *FOCUS mode*: capturing video frames without storing them
. *ACQUIRE mode*: captures video frames _and_ stores acquired data

You can start/stop either of the capturing modes by clicking on the button at the bottom of the main window.

[IMPORTANT]
*Pose-Trigger does _not_ stream data into storage during acquisition!* During acquisition, it keeps all the data in-memory. The data will be written out to a file only _after_ acquisition. The duration of acquisition will be thus limited to the order of 1–2 minutes.

[IMPORTANT]
====

Currently, the following parameters are "hard-coded" and used as default:

- Image format: 640x480 pixels, 16-bit grayscale
- Timing generation: a busy-wait algorithm
- Storage format: the NumPy zip-file format (.npz)

====

==== Format of the saved files

The data are saved in the NumPy zip-file format (i.e. ".npz" file). Each file includes the following entries:

.Table Entries in saved files
[%header]
|===
| Name         | Always there?  | Description
| `frames`     | Yes            | frame data, with the 3-D shape being (frame-index, height, width)
| `timestamps` | Yes            | 1-D array containing unix timestamps in seconds
| `metadata`   | Yes            | a JSON-serialized text object containing information on acquisition configuration
| `estimation` | No (Optional)  | when a DeepLabCut project is selected; 3-D array with the (frame-index, parameter) shape
| `trigger_status` | No (Optional) | when pose-evaluation is enabled; 1-D boolean array of evaluation results
|===

(TODO: examples)

== Panel-by-panel guide

=== "Camera" panel

."Camera" panel for capture-parameter settings
image::resources/Panels_camera.png[Capture parameter settings]

Here, you can set the exposure and the gain of each video frame acquisition.

[NOTE]
For the time being, the image format is restricted to 16-bit grayscale, with the 640x480 frame size (otherwise there will be an unexpected behavior).

=== "Preprocessing" panel

."Preprocessing" settings
image::resources/Panels_preprocessing.png[Preprocessing settings]

This controls the brightness/contrast settings for "live" video frames. It controls signal conditioning parameters for:

- Video-frame preview
- Body-part estimation (the images being fed to DeepLabCut)

On the other hand, *the raw, unconditioned images are used* for data storage.

=== "Acquisition" panel

."Acquisition" timing control
image::resources/Panels_acquisition.png[Acquisition timing control]

Here you can set the (targeted) acquisition intervals. For example, if you want to have Pose-Trigger running at 50 Hz, set this interval to 20 ms.

[NOTE]
For the time being, you can only choose to use the busy-wait timing-generation mechanism.

=== "DeepLabCut evaluation" panel

."Evaluation" mode control
image::resources/Panels_evaluation.png[Evaluation mode control]

Here, you can configure how DeepLabCut should work in real-time.

==== Project selection

By using the "Select" button, you can select your DeepLabCut project of choice. Conversely, by clicking on the "Clear" button, you can un-set the project.

When a project is selected, the panel shows the body-part labels being registered in the project.

As long as a project is selected here, body-part position estimation occurs during video-capture processes. Estimated positions will also be stored in the data file in the case of the `ACQUIRE` mode.

==== Pose evaluation

You can enable pose evaluation by ticking the "Enable evaluation" button. Evaluation occurs using *the boolean expression entered in the "Expression" field*. The "expression" can be any Python one-line expression, but it has to be evaluated to be a boolean.

When specifying the boolean expression, you can use a *placeholder-based reference* to body part positions. For example, by entering `{Tip1.x}`, you can use the X coordinate of `Tip1` as a parameter. Other than the `x` property, you can also use the `y` and `p` properties of a body part to refer to the Y coordinate and the probability

In computation of the expression, some major libraries can be used: use `math` for representing the `math` standard library, and use `np` to refer to the `numpy` library. For example, the expression below calculates the Euclidean distance between two body parts, `Tip1` and `Tip2`:

[source]
--
math.sqrt( ({Tip1.x} - {Tip2.x})**2 + ({Tip1.y} - {Tip2.y})**2 )
--

In addition, to enable testing of the output latency at the trigger-generation step, the custom placeholder, `{EVERY10}` is there. By using the following expression, you can toggle trigger output on and off every 10 frames:

[source]
--
{EVERY10}.get()
--


=== "Trigger generation" panel

."Trigger" mode control
image::resources/Panels_triggering.png[Trigger mode control]

Here, you can test and control trigger generation.

==== Transferring evaluation results to FastEventServer

By ticking "Enable trigger output", it starts sending the result of evaluation (true/false value) to FastEventServer.

==== Manually toggling the trigger

When trigger-output based on evaluation results is disabled, you can manually toggle the trigger output on and off, using the "Toggle manually" button.

[IMPORTANT]
For the time being, the "trigger UDP port" cannot be specified; if Pose-Trigger fails to connect to FastEventServer on port 11666 at the beginning of its launching, it just disables the trigger-output functionality.

=== "Storage" panel

."Storage" control
image::resources/Panels_storage.png[Storage control]

Here, you can control how acquired data are stored.

*File names are automatically generated* using the text entered in the "File-name format" field. You can use the following *format directives*. These fields are passed on straight to the `datetime.strftime` method (refer to https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior[the python datetime module documentation] on the specific format directives).

[IMPORTANT]
Be cautious of Pose-Trigger *automatically overwriting existing files*! Try to include (at least) the minutes/seconds directive into the file-name format, so that you do not unexpectedly delete your previous videos.

(TODO)

=== The Arduino output board

==== Pinouts

It only uses the *6-pin header of the ATmega16U2 chip* on the UNO (see below).
Only the `EVENT` channel (the `PB1` pin) is used for trigger outputs in Pose-Trigger.

In combination with the `GND` pin (in the top-left of the image), you can use the output as a TTL signal.

image::resources/header-pinout.png[6-pin header pinout]


==== Communication

You can use the serial communication to communicate with the board, without a running FastEventServer.

[TIP]
Since the board, as a USB device, only "emulates" the serial port, you can communicate with the board no matter the baud-rate setting.

[TIP]
If you use the board from FastEventServer, you cannot open it or use it separately.

===== Finding which device represents the output board

Plug in and out the board, and run `ls -l /dev | grep ttyACM` each time. There must be a name (e.g. `ttyACM0`) that appears only when you plug in the board.

===== Commands

A single character corresponds to a command:

.Command set
|===
|Character |Meaning
|`L`       |`EVENT`: turn on the output
|`H`       |`CLEAR`: turn off the output
|===

==== Setting up

The original repository does not provide a working copy of the program, so you need to build it.

Basically you can follow the procedures written in the https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3515998[arduino-fasteventtrigger repository], but the sequence is depicted here briefly, too.

===== Concepts

In essence, installation requires:

. *Downloading of the code from the https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3515998[arduino-fasteventtrigger repository]*. Note that it does not provide a working binary, so you need to compile it yourself (see below).
. *Downloading of the http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php[LUFA library]*: it is used in Arduino project to turn an AVR microcontroller to a USB device, so that users can communicate with Arduino's using USB cables.
. *Compilation of the code*: it requires a https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/UsingAVR[cross-compiler] (i.e. a program working on a desktop computer to build a program working on a chip on Arduino).
. *Transfer of the binary* into the serial-usb chip of Arduino: here, a special mode of the USB-serial chip, being referred to as https://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/DFUProgramming8U2[Device Firmware Update (DFU) mode], is used. Using the DFU mode, you can upload the program to the Arduino chip directly through the USB cable.

===== Procedures

Procedures are as below:

. *Install required libraries and binaries*:
.. http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php[LUFA] (*IMPORTANT: use version 100807–111009*): download the ZIP archive, and extract in whichever directory you feel comfortable. The specified versions are those being used for development of Arduino.
.. http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/[avr-gcc cross-compiler]: on linux, you can install it by running e.g. `sudo apt-get install avr-gcc`. Alternatively (at least on the Mac), you can use the binaries coming with the Arduino GUI (this is the strategy adopted by `add_avr.sh` in the `arduino-fasteventtrigger` repository).
.. http://dfu-programmer.github.io/[dfu-programmer]: this is the program (on the PC side) to transfer programs to the Arduino chip. On linux, you should also be able to install it by running `sudo apt-get install dfu-programmer`.
. *Make sure that your Terminal can find the necessary programs*, by running the command `which <program-name>`:
.. `avr-gcc`
.. `avr-objcopy`
.. `avr-objdump`
.. `avr-size`
.. `avr-ar`
.. `avr-nm`
.. `dfu-programmer`
. *Download the https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3515998[arduino-fasteventtrigger repository]*; place the extracted / cloned directory under the "Projects" directory of LUFA.
. *Compile the program*: open the "arduino-fasteventtrigger" repository in Terminal, and run `make clean && make`. This will build the program to be uploaded to the Arduino chip.
. *Put the Arduino into the DFU mode*:
.. First, connect Arduino to the PC using the USB cable.
.. (On linux) Check that the PC recognize the Arduino: plug the device in and out, and run `ls -l /dev | grep ttyACM` each time. There must be a name (e.g. `ttyACM0`) that appears only when you plug in the Arduino.
.. While keeping the Arduino connected to the PC, connecting the `RESET` and `GND` pins of the ATmega16U2 6-pin header using a lead (see the image below, or refer to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/DFUProgramming8U2[the guide in the Arduino project]).
.. Now run `ls -l /dev | grep ttyACM` again on the Terminal, and make sure that you do _not_ find the name of the Arduino on the output. This disappearance is the hallmark of the Arduino turning into the DFU mode.
. *Transfer the program*: in the `arduino-fasteventtrigger` directory, run `make dfu`. In case of any errors (they can occur from time to time), try running the same command again.
. *Check output signals*: the best way is to use a serial-monitor program, and send the commands. Alternatively, you may also be able to check it by the "Toggle Manually" button on the Pose-Trigger main window.
